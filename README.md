# MERN Stack: Novice to Ninja
A step-by-step tutorial to learn how to create your own app using the MERN stack

## Step 1: A taste of success

In step 1, we create a simple Hello World app, host it on a server using
node and express. We use react and react transoformers off a CDN, so the
amount of code in the repo is very minimal. We are yet to hook it to
Mongo or any other backend, the first few steps are aimed at learning
React more than anything else.

## Step 2: React the right way

In the previous step, we used a JSX transformer in the browser. This approach is
inefficient. In this step, we will move the transformation to build time. The two
popular task-running tools are grunt and gulp. Here, we use gulp. 

In this step, we will use gulp to only transform JSX, later, we will use gulp for
automating other tasks as well.

Additional installs for this step:
